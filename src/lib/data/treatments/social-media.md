## Breaking Social Media Addiction
### Understanding the Cycle
Social media platforms are designed to be addictive through variable reward schedules and infinite scroll. Each notification triggers dopamine release, creating a habit loop.
### Evidence-Based Strategies
**1. Digital Detox (Gradual)**
- Start with 1-hour phone-free periods
- Gradually extend to half-day breaks
- Use grayscale mode to reduce visual appeal
**2. Environment Design**
- Remove apps from home screen
- Disable all non-essential notifications
- Use website blockers during focus time
**3. Replacement Activities**
- Physical exercise (releases dopamine naturally)
- Reading physical books
- Face-to-face social interaction
**4. Mindfulness Practice**
- Notice urges without acting (10-minute rule)
- Practice RAIN: Recognize, Allow, Investigate, Non-identify
- Journal about triggers and emotions
### Recovery Timeline
- Week 1-2: Intense cravings, anxiety
- Week 3-4: Cravings reduce, boredom increases
- Month 2-3: New habits form, mental clarity improves
- Month 6+: Sustainable lifestyle change
### Professional Help
Consider therapy if:
- Unable to reduce usage despite negative consequences
- Experiencing severe anxiety or depression
- Social media use interferes with work/relationships
