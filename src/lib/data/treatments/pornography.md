## Recovery from Pornography Addiction
### Understanding the Impact
Pornography can rewire the brain's reward system, leading to escalating tolerance, relationship problems, and diminished real-world intimacy.
### Recovery Strategies
**1. Complete Digital Environment Change**
- Install accountability software (Covenant Eyes, Qustodio)
- Move devices out of bedroom
- Never use internet alone during vulnerable times
- Use DNS-level filtering (CleanBrowsing, OpenDNS)
**2. Neuroplasticity Reset (90-Day Reboot)**
- Abstain from all pornography and masturbation
- Brain begins rewiring dopamine pathways
- Expect withdrawal: anxiety, mood swings, insomnia
- "Flatline" period (weeks 2-6): low libido is normal
**3. Urge Surfing Technique**
- Urges peak at 15-20 minutes then subside
- Physical activity during urges (push-ups, cold shower)
- "HALT" check: Hungry, Angry, Lonely, Tired?
- Call accountability partner
**4. Address Root Causes**
- Stress/anxiety → Meditation, therapy
- Loneliness → Build genuine connections
- Boredom → Develop engaging hobbies
- Trauma → Professional counseling
**5. Relationship Repair**
- Honest disclosure with partner (consider therapist present)
- Couples counseling if in relationship
- Learn healthy intimacy patterns
### Support Resources

- SAA (Sex Addicts Anonymous) meetings
- CSAT-certified therapist (Certified Sex Addiction Therapist)
### Long-Term Maintenance
- Continue accountability relationships
- Regular exercise and sleep hygiene
