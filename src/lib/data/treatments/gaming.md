## Overcoming Gaming Addiction
### Recognition
Gaming becomes problematic when it interferes with sleep, work, relationships, or physical health. Key signs include loss of interest in other activities and continued play despite negative consequences.
### Treatment Approaches
**1. Structured Gaming Schedule**
- Set specific gaming windows (e.g., 1 hour after dinner)
- Use timers and stick to limits
- No gaming before completing daily responsibilities
**2. Identify Psychological Needs**
Gaming often fulfills needs for:
- Achievement → Seek real-world goals
- Social connection → Join clubs or groups
- Escape → Address underlying stress/anxiety
**3. Physical Health Recovery**
- Re-establish sleep schedule (no screens 2h before bed)
- Regular exercise to restore dopamine balance
- Proper nutrition and hydration
**4. Social Reconnection**
- Schedule regular in-person meetups
- Join hobby groups or sports teams
- Volunteer work for sense of purpose
### Harm Reduction (If Complete Abstinence Is Difficult)
- Switch to games with natural endpoints
- Avoid games with loot boxes or pay-to-win mechanics
- Play only with real-life friends (time-limited sessions)
### When to Seek Help
- Gaming 30+ hours/week
- Neglecting hygiene or health
- Job loss or academic failure
- Relationship breakdown
