# The Science of Behavioral Change

Understanding the psychology behind addiction and behavioral patterns can help you make better decisions when faced with temptation.

## The Regret Aversion Principle

Research in behavioral economics has shown that humans are remarkably influenced by past regrets. The **regret aversion principle** suggests that people often make decisions to avoid future regret rather than to maximize pleasure.

> "The pain of regret is often more powerful than the anticipation of pleasure." — Daniel Kahneman, Nobel Prize Winner in Economics

This app leverages this principle by making your past regrets immediately accessible when you're about to make a decision you might later regret.

## The Dopamine Loop

Modern technology exploits our brain's reward system. Every notification, like, or infinite scroll triggers a dopamine release, creating a powerful feedback loop:

1. **Trigger** — You feel bored, anxious, or seeking validation
2. **Action** — You open the app or engage in the behavior
3. **Reward** — Brief dopamine hit from novelty/validation
4. **Craving** — Brain wants more, loop repeats

The problem? This loop is designed to be addictive. Companies employ psychologists and use A/B testing to maximize engagement, which often means maximizing your time spent (and your regret later).

## Implementation Intentions

Research by psychologist Peter Gollwitzer shows that *implementation intentions* — specific if-then plans — dramatically increase success rates for behavioral change.

Instead of vague goals like "I'll use social media less," try:

- **IF** I feel the urge to check social media, **THEN** I'll open unbehave and review my regrets
- **IF** I'm tempted to play games all day, **THEN** I'll read my past regrets first

This app serves as your implementation intention tool.

## The Mere Exposure Effect

Repeated exposure to your regrets creates a psychological association between the temptation and the negative outcomes. Over time, this can rewire your automatic responses.

Studies show it takes 30-90 days to form new habits. Consistency is key — even small victories add up.

## Cognitive Behavioral Techniques

This app incorporates elements of **Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)**, which is proven effective for addiction and impulse control:

- **Awareness** — Tracking temptations makes you conscious of patterns
- **Reflection** — Writing regrets helps process emotions and consequences
- **Intervention** — Pausing before acting disrupts automatic behaviors

## Why This Works

Traditional willpower alone often fails because:

1. Willpower is a limited resource (ego depletion)
2. Future consequences feel abstract and distant
3. The dopamine hit is immediate and tangible

By making past regrets **immediate** and **visceral**, this app helps balance the equation. Your brain gets a competing emotional signal that can override the craving.
